Test the mandatory methods of a Java RPC server
(ping/reflection). This is done by using a C++ client against a
barebone Java server. The ping method is used to poll the server while
waiting for it to come up. The reflection methods are used to extract
reflection information about the mandatory methods, which is checked
against a checked-in expected result.

This test will break easily if the documentation of the mandatory
methods is changed or if the method iteration order is changed. This
will not happen often, and the test is easily updated.
