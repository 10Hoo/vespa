Juniper configuration and build instructions
--------------------------------------------------

Juniper basically adheres to the standard FastOS configure/build environment.

configure --help 

gives a list of configure options.

Juniper supports most of the common build targets.

Default configure parameters are set to assume that other dependent Fast modules
are located at the same directory level as this modul. 
Default is to expect the minimal required set of modules.

Prerequisites:
----------------
Common module dependencies:

fastos and fastlib must have been built and installed.

This version of Juniper requires fastlib 1.5.16 or higher.
To be able to utilize the functionality for building in a different
directory, fastos <= 1.6.0 is required.

Postgres Document Store (optional,obsolete)
---------------------------------------------
To build with Document Store support, Postgres must have been installed and
path to this installation provided with the --pgsql-dir option. Default is
to view document store as external to this module.


libiconv (optional) 
--------------------------
The 3rdparty module libiconv is needed to run the unit tests in the src/tests directory.


To build/install this module:
-----------------------------------

1)  run configure

    A shell script named config_command.sh / config_command.bat will be updated to contain last
    used configure command to avoid having to re-remember the configure
    options currently in use.

2)  make depend

3)  make install
