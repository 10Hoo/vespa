This module implements a result processing solution to create 
dynamic teasers and proximity boosting of documents based on the
input query. 

The module offers the following main interface:

rpinterface.h

    This interface provides access for Juniper to full query structure information.
    The query provider needs to implement the IQuery interface to allow Juniper 
    to traverse the query and possibly obtain additional information about each term.
    (see query.h which is included by rpinterface.h)

    This is the preferred result processing interface to Juniper.

    src/rpclient/testclient.cpp

    is an example of use of this interface.
