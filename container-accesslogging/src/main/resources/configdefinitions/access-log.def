# Defines how file rotation is done. There are two options:
#
# DATE:
# The active log file is given the name resulting from pattern (but in this case "pattern" must yield a
# time-dependent name. In addition, a symlink is created pointing to the newest file.
# The symlink is given the name of the symlink parameter (or the name of this service
# if no parameter is given.
#
# SEQUENCE:
# The active log file is given the name
# defined by "pattern" (which in this case will likely just be a constant string).
# At rotation, this file is given the name pattern.N where N is 1 + the largest integer found by
# extracting the integers from all files ending by .Integer in the same directory
#

# Use this as the name of the symlink created pointing to the newest file in the "date" naming scheme.
# This is ignored if the sequence naming scheme is used.
