## A config to control whether to activate strict adherence to public contracts
## in the container. Usually, the container tries to do a best effort of hiding
## some undesirable effects of the the public contracts. Modifying this config
## signals the basic contract is sufficient, and allows the container to
## activate optimizations based on this knowledge.

## Strict contracts for search chains, do not clone the query if it at all
## can be construed to be unnecessary.
