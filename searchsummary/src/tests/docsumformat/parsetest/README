The files in this directory are used to test the parsing of document
summary format config files. The files are named by the following
rules:

incorrect.*  : these files are incorrect; loading them should fail.

correct.*    : these files are correct; loading them should succeed.

OK.correct.* : these files contain normalized config on 'summary.cf'
               format that matches the config contained in
               the corresponding 'correct.*' files.

The 'docsum-parse' program loops through all files in this
directory. For each file that has a name beginning with 'incorrect.',
it checks that loading document summary format config from it
fails. For each file that has a name beginning with 'correct.', it
checks that document summary format config may be read from the
file. It then writes the config back to a file named 'out.correct.<>',
reads the newly generated file back in, reads the corresponding
'OK.correct.<>' file and checks that all 3 configs are exactly the
same.

New tests may be added simply be adding files conforming to the above
rules to this directory.
