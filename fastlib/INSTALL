How do I build and install the C++ library?

  cd src/cpp
  ./configure --fastos-dir <full path to fastos> [--help | <options>]
  make -s bootstrap
  make -s install

The default install directory is '../..' (relative to the src/cpp
directory). This means that the library file will be installed in
../../lib/ and the include files in ../../include/fastlib/.
To override the default install directory, use the configure option
'--install-dir'. Try './configure --fastos-dir <fastosdir> --help'
for all available options.

Support for additional functionality is available when configuring
with --libxml2-dir <full path to libxml2>.
The XML include files must have been installed in
<libxml2-dir>/includes/libxml2/libxml
The XML library must have been installed as
<libxml2-dir>/lib/libxml2.a (or xml2.a on Windows)

What kind of make targets are available, and what do they do?

make depend              - generate make-dependancy information
make makefiles           - generate makefiles for all modules
make clean               - delete all intermediate and output files
make cleandir            - does 'make clean' + deletes depend info
make install             - install the library and include files
                           to location $(INSTALLDIR)
make kdoc                - generate kdoc documentation
make doxygen             - generate doxygen documentation
make bootstrap           - (recommended build target) does:
                                 make cleandir
                                 make depend
                                 make makefiles
                                 make
make tests               - Compiles test programs, and runs them.
                           If a test program fails to compile or run,
                           the make process is stopped.
                           Please run 'make tests' after changing fastlib code
                           to ensure you have not broken anything.
