CloudConfig Runtime Environment

The services package contains (via dependencies)
common runtime cloudconfig components.

The services package adds a set of environment settings that are used by several
of the control scripts and binaries that use cloud config. The
current list looks like this:

# set port_configserver_rpc
# set addr_configserver
    
These values allow the other components to locate the configuration
server, thus enabling them to get their config.
