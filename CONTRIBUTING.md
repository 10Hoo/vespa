# Contributing to Vespa
We appreciate contributions to Vespa!
Below is a quick how-to


## Reporting issues
Reporting a problem is a valuable contribution.
Use GitHub issues to report bugs. Issues are evaluated almost daily


## Check the ToDo list
Future features are kept on the [ToDo list](TODO.md) - 
minor fixes better reported in issues.


## Build custom plugins
Vespa has great support for custom plugins -
you will often find that the best way to implement your application is by writing a plugin -
refer to the [APIs](http://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/api.html).


## Where to start contributing
Most features plug into the Vespa Container - this is the most likely pleace to write enhancements.
Discuss with the community if others have similar feature requests - make the feature generic.

### Getting started
