FNET is a multi-threaded object-oriented networking library based on
FastOS. FRT implements a proprietary RPC protocol on top of FNET.

For release information, read the RELEASEINFO file.

Notes from the maintainer:

This library is work in progress. This means that some APIs may change
in new versions. I will try to keep these changes to a minimum and
also document them in the RELEASEINFO file.

No extra effort has been added to hide things from the users of this
library. This means that you can use components like the scheduler to
implement a scheduler thread that has nothing to do with
networking. It also means that you have to expect to handle more API
changes if you are using classes not intended for direct use. It also
means that you will have access to methods you were never meant to
invoke. If this becomes a problem, I will start making things private
and the classes more 'friendly'.
