This module contains a generic application framework for a C++ server
process. It provides functionality such as metrics, status pages, memory
management and deadlock detection.

This used to be coded into the storage module itself, but we want the generic
stuff to be available to others. The driver for moving is that storage now
splits its own memfile persistence layer out of storage, and we want both parts
to have the same utilities available.

This module should hopefully not contain very storage specific stuff.
