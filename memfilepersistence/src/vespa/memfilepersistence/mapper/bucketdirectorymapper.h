 * \class storage::memfile::BucketDirectoryMapper
 * \ingroup memfile
 *
 * \brief Maps buckets to directories on disk.
 *
 * To avoid having too many files in one directory, we want to map buckets to
 * different directories. As these are all in the same partition anyways, we
 * don't really need the distribution to be different based on node indexes or
 * disk indexes.
 *
 * This class hides a simple function for distributing buckets between
 * directories.
