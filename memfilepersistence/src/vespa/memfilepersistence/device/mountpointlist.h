 * \class storage::MountPointList
 * \ingroup persistence
 *
 * \brief Class holding information about the mount points used by storage
 *
 * We need to keep a list of mount points, to read and write the mount point
 * file, and to access what mount points should be used and not.
 *
 * NOTE: A mountpoint is often referred to as a disk, even though you technicly
 * can have multiple mountpoints per partition and multiple partitions per disk.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Remember to call verifyHealthyDisks() before starting to use them.
