Java library for request-response data processing.

This library defines request-response processing as an operation which
accepts a Request and produces a Response containing Data by executing
a Chain of processing components in a single worker thread using method
calls for chaining, i.e a synchronous processing model.
Data for the Response may optionally be produced asynchronously.

The processing model can be implemented by subtyping in frameworks defining
a processing model (with a richer, more specific API) for a particular domain.
